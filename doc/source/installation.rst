============

1. If you have not git yet, install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Install dicttools library using pip (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)

    $ pip install git+git://github.com/trzemecki/dicttools.git

It it also possible to install it by cloning repository with zip on desktop, unpack it and then run setup.py,
but is more complicated than the way by using pip, so it will not be described.
